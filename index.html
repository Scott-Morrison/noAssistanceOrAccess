            <h1>end to end encryption is a basic human right</h1>
<aside>time and time again our information is leaked due to poor standards of end to end encryption, yet the people do not stand up and demand to be safe online.
      Again it is time for us to stand up as a collective and fight for what we know to be the obvious progression forward for a democratized world.
      It is time to begin fighting for our right to be safe when discussing anything we want.
      It is time to see the internet as an extention of traditional forms of communication and realize that we deserve to be as safe as you are discussing something in person with someone.
      This means standing up for the right to have standards of privacy by design made possible by end to end encryption.
      If we want the internet to be an extention of human comminication, we must capture the elements of trust found in person to person interactions.</aside>
